Oh dear, someone found this website.

Ok, look, I love https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] and I found https://antora.org[Antora].
So, I thought I give it a try.

Besides, it wouldn't hurt, if I polish and publish some of the things that I do/did.
A bold idea, considering that I hardly have any time besides family, work, friends and household.
But as always, Seth Godin gives me strength:

So, I passed https://sketchplanations.com/the-doorstep-mile[the doorstep mile].
Here we go:

== Projects

asciidoc-templates::
include::asciidoc-templates:ROOT:partial$repository-description.adoc[]
Here is the xref:asciidoc-templates:ROOT:index.adoc[documentation].

Echo::
I started this project towards the end of year 2022.
The end of 2022 was busy, and in January 2023, I started a new job.
Therefore, the project [.line-through]#progresses very slowly# doesn't progress at all.
The functionality of the application will be similar to what https://webhook.site[] is doing.
I planned it to be a reactive Spring Boot application with a REST and a GraphQL API.
If I ever continue, I will probably rewrite everything in Kotlin and use Ktor or Vertx.
Anyway, here is some xref:echo:ROOT:index.adoc[documentation].

transpose-gherkin-datatable::
An evening of boredom and the urge to finally write something in Kotlin led to this project.
It's a command line tool to transpose gherkin data tables.
Its functionality is completely secondary.
It's main purpose was to act as a playground for:
https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin], https://ajalt.github.io/clikt/[Clikt], https://ajalt.github.io/mordant/[Mordant] and https://mooltiverse.github.io/nyx/[Nyx]. The git repository is https://github.com/harmenweber/transpose-gherkin-datatable[here].

roll::
A simple command line tool to roll dice.
For example, execute `roll 3d6 2d8` to roll three six sided dice and two eight sided dice.
The git repository is https://github.com/harmenweber/roll[here].

shell-script-template::
The shell-script-template repository contains resources that come in handy when writing shell scripts.
The main piece is a shell script template containing the usual boilerplate like:
+
--
* identifying script name and home folder
* options reading and handling
* usage printing
* and more.

Further, the repository contains some example shell scripts and some handy functions.

The repository is not public yet.
It still requires polishing.
Stay tuned.

rat::
rat is a prototype of some realtime asset tracking application that I implemented together with my colleague Roman MÃ¤der.
The prototype has an Angular frontend and a NestJS backend.
The backend accepts position data from IoT devices, stores it and publishes it to subscribed clients (using GraphQL subscriptions).
Subscribed clients update the position of the IoT devices on the map as new position data gets published.
As a result, users get the position of their IoT devices displayed and updated in near-realtime and without having to refresh/reload their browser or mobile app.
+
I'm afraid, the repository is private and there is no public documentation.
