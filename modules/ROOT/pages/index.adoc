Below are some sections on different levels.
Just to see what these different levels will look like.

[[test-anchor]]
== Level 2

This is a second level section.

=== Level 3

This is a third level section.

==== Level 4

This is a fourth level section.

===== Level 5

This is a fifth level section.

== Paragraphs

Below are some paragraphs to see how multiple paragraphs in a row behave.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

Seemingly, paragraphs themselves can have titles.
The following paragraph for example will have a short title.
Let's see how it looks.

.Short Title
This is the second paragraph which should have a small title.
Let's see how that looks once I generate a PDF or an HTML for it.

.Inline Literal
There are inline literals.
I create here one mainly to see whether it looks nice in my themes.
Here is an inline literal: `asciidoc2pdf simple-article.adoc`.
Let's see how that looks if there is text around it.
Does the border offset and the border radius look good?

.Literal Paragraph
I can create literal paragraphs.
That means it will be monospaced and any whitespaces will be kept and not removed.
This can be useful for certain things like ascii art.
The paragraph below is a literal paragraph.

        _   ,_,   _
       / `'=) (='` \
      /.-.-.\ /.-.-.\
      `      "      `

I hope one can see the ascii art above correctly.

== Text Formatting

Here is a paragraph with that contains texts with different formatting.
Here is some italic text: _Halleluja!_
And here is some bold text: **Yaba daba dooo!**
Of course, there are also code blocks like this one: echo `"Hello World!"`

Something I didn't know existed, is #marked text#.

== Admonitions

One can create notes in to variations.

NOTE: This is a note without a title.
I add a bit more text to it to see whether vim properly formats this variation of writing a note.
Unfortunately, vim isn't that smart.
But it doesn't matter.
Asciidoctor-pdf obviously can handle the note even if it isn't formatted perfectly.

.Note Title
NOTE: This is a note with a title.

TIP: This is a tip.

WARNING:  This is a warning.

IMPORTANT: This is important.

CAUTION: Here you need to be cautious.

== Example Blocks

An example block is useful for visually delineating content that illustrates a concept or showing the result of an operation.
An example can contain any type of content and AsciiDoc syntax.
Normal substitutions are applied to example content.

If the example content is contiguous, i.e., not interrupted by empty lines, the block style name `example` can be placed directly on top of the text in an attribute list (`[]`).

If the example content includes multiple blocks or content separated by empty lines, place the content between delimiter lines consisting of four equals signs (`====`).

.Onomatopoeia
====
The book hit the floor with a *thud*.

He could hear doves _cooing_ in the pine trees' branches.
====

== Sidebars

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

.Optional Title
****
Sidebars are used to visually separate auxiliary bits of content that supplement the main text.

TIP: They can contain any type of content.

.Source code block in a sidebar
[source,js]
----
const { expect, expectCalledWith, heredoc } = require('../test/test-utils')
----
****

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

== Source Code

Below is some source code:

[source,shell]
ps -ef | grep java

I can also create multi-line souce code blocks:

.Multi-Line Source Code Block
[source,javascript,linenums,highlight=2]
----
function log(message) { <1>
    console.log(getDateTime() + ": " + message); <2>
}
----

<1> Declaration of the log function.
<2> Logging the current datetime followed by the log message.

== Icons

This is actually a feature documented at https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/#font-based-icons.
Take a look at it.

Here is a fontawesome icon: icon:comment[].

And here is an icon from another icon set: icon:amazon[set=pf].

You can even set the size of the icons: icon:smile[size=2em]

== Keyboard

The keyboard macro uses the short (no target) macro syntax `+kbd:[key(+key)*]+`.
Each key is displayed as entered in the document.
Multiple keys are separated by a plus (e.g., `Ctrl+T`) or a comma (e.g., `Ctrl,T`).
The plus is preferred.
It’s customary to represent alpha keys in uppercase, though this is not enforced.
If the last key is a backslash (`\`), it must be followed by a space.
Without this space, the processor will not recognize the macro.
If one of the keys is a closing square bracket (`]`), it must be proceeded by a backslash.
Without the backslash escape, the macro will end prematurely.
You can find example of these cases in the example below.
Here are some examples:

|===
|Shortcut |Purpose

|kbd:[F11]
|Toggle fullscreen

|kbd:[Ctrl+T]
|Open a new tab

|kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+N]
|New incognito window

|kbd:[\ ]
|Used to escape characters

|kbd:[Ctrl+\]]
|Jump to keyword

|kbd:[Ctrl + +]
|Increase zoom
|===

== Buttons

It can be difficult to communicate to the reader that they need to press a button.
They can’t tell if you are saying “OK” or they are supposed to look for a button labeled OK.
It’s all about getting the semantics right.
The btn macro to the rescue!
Here are some examples:

Press the btn:[Ok] button when you are finished. +
Select a file in the file navigator and click btn:[Open].

== Menus

Trying to explain how to select a menu item can be a pain.
With the menu macro, the symbols do the work.
Here are some examples:

To save the file, select menu:File[Save]. +
Select menu:View[Zoom > Reset] to reset the zoom level to the default setting.

== Definitions

The typical definitions look as follows:

GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.

However, you can also create horizontal definitions.

[horizontal]
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.
I'm adding here more text to it to see how the term gets verically aligned.
Nice, the term is top aligned.

You can also create them so they have markers.
These markers are either unordered:

[unordered]
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.
I'm adding here more text to it to see how the term gets verically aligned.
Nice, the term is top aligned.

Or ordered:

[ordered]
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.
I'm adding here more text to it to see how the term gets verically aligned.
Nice, the term is top aligned.

By default, the subject (i.e., the term) is followed immediately by a colon (still in bold) and offset from the description by a space.
You can replace the colon with another character (or sequence of characters) using the block attribute named `subject-stop`.

[unordered,subject-stop=" >"]
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.
I'm adding here more text to it to see how the term gets verically aligned.
Nice, the term is top aligned.

A description list with marker uses a run-in layout by default.
In other words, the subject appears on the same line as the description, separated by the subject stop and a space.
To make the subject appear above the description, like in a normal description list, add the stack role to the list.
In this case, the stop character is only added if specified explicitly.

[unordered.stack]
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.
I'm adding here more text to it to see how the term gets verically aligned.
Nice, the term is top aligned.

== Q&A

[qanda]
What is the answer to the universe, god and everything?::
The answer is 42.

What time is today?::
I don't know.
Maybe 22:00?

What day is it today?::
It is Sunday 2020-12-13.

== Tables

There are awesome table features.
You can actually just paste CSV into your document ant it will create a table for it.
So you don't have to wiggle and bring your data into the markdown specific format.
Just awesome.

[cols="^,<,<s,<,>m",options="header",frame="none",grid="rows",format="csv"]
|===========================
ID,FName,LName,Address,Phone

1,Vasya,Pupkin,London,+123
2,X,Y,"A,B",45678
|===========================

== Lists

* [ ] Todo 1
* [x] Todo 2 (done)

== Anchors & Cross References

This is a cross-reference to an anchor defined earlier in the document: <<test-anchor,link>>.

Alternatively, one can link directly to any header in the document like this: <<Admonitions>>.

== Blockquotes

After landing the cloaked Klingon bird of prey in Golden Gate park:

[quote,Captain James T. Kirk,Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]
____
Everybody remember where we parked.
____

== Verse

When you need to preserve indents and line breaks, use a verse block.
Verses are defined by setting `verse` on a paragraph or an excerpt block delimited by four underscores.

[verse,Carl Sandburg,Fog]
____
The fog comes
on little cat feet.

It sits looking
over harbor and city
on silent haunches
and then moves on.
____

== Images

There are two AsciiDoc image macro types, block and inline.
As with all macros, the block and inline forms differ by the number of colons that follow the macro name.
The block form uses two colons (`::`), whereas the inline form only uses one (`:`).

Here is an example block image:

image::sunset.jpg[]

And here is an example of the same block image but with an ID, a caption, a link, and size attributes.

[#img-sunset]
.A mountain sunset
[link=https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/_images/sunset.jpg]
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset,200,100]

And here are two examples of inline images.
The second one has a title that will be displaye when hovering over the image (at least in HTML).

Click image:play.png[] to get the party started. +
Click image:pause.png[title="Pause"] when you need a break.

== Horizontal Rule

Here is some text that is followed by a horizontal rule.

'''

And then the text continues.
