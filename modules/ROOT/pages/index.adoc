Oh dear, someone found this website.

Ok, look, I love https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] and I found https://antora.org[Antora].
So, I thought I give it a try.

Besides, it wouldn't hurt, if I polish and publish some of the things that I do/did.
A bold idea, considering that I hardly have any time besides family, work, friends and household.
But as always, Seth Godin gives me strength:

So, I passed https://sketchplanations.com/the-doorstep-mile[the doorstep mile].
Here we go:

== Projects

asciidoc-templates::
include::asciidoc-templates:ROOT:partial$repository-description.adoc[]
Here is the xref:asciidoc-templates:ROOT:index.adoc[documentation].

Echo::
This is a project that I plan to realize.
Mainly to get my hands dirty on Spring Boot 3 that is about to get released towards the end of year 2022.
The functionality of the application will be similar to what https://webhook.site[] is doing.
The application will be reactive and native.
It will expose a REST and a GraphQL API.
Here is some xref:echo:ROOT:index.adoc[documentation].

shell-script-template::
The shell-script-template repository contains resources that come in handy when writing shell scripts.
The main piece is a shell script template containing the usual boilerplate like:
+
--
* identifying script name and home folder
* options reading and handling
* usage printing
* and more.

Further, the repository contains some example shell scripts and some handy functions.

The repository is not public yet.
It still requires polishing.
Stay tuned.

rat::
rat is a prototype of some realtime asset tracking application that I implemented together with my colleague Roman MÃ¤der.
The prototype has an Angular frontend and a NestJS backend.
The backend accepts position data from IoT devices, stores it and publishes it to subscribed clients (using GraphQL subscriptions).
Subscribed clients update the position of the IoT devices on the map as new position data gets published.
As a result, users get the position of their IoT devices displayed and updated in near-realtime and without having to refresh/reload their browser or mobile app.
+
The repository is private and there is no public documentation.
However, the prototype is deployed and can be seen at https://rat-web-dev.harmen.ch[].
Currently, six simulated IoT devices are running back and forth between the cities Baar and Zurich.
